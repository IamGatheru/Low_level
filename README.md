#Low_Level

- I am excited to begin my journey as a Malware Analyst. 
- My plan is to document everything that I will be doing till I become cracked.
- I will be sharing books, the source files and brief notes on the content I  will be interacting with as well as the lessons learnt.

- This repository will contain program source files, executables and assembly[Intel] code.  The README.md file(in the parent folder) will contain notes, book titles and youtube content that I will find  along the way.

- I will organise this project into folders for easy access to materials. Each folder will contain a README.md file that will present details contained in the folder.

- The source files will have comments based on my own understanding of the code. On this I promise to be as precise as I can. However, omissions may occur uintentionally and in that  case, It will be my doing. 

- The source file will have the extension .c, the executable will match the source file without the extension and the assembly file will be the executable_asm.txt

- I will try to use gcc to compile with all my source code using only the '-g' flag to give the debugger(gdb) access to the source file.

- You can reach out to me @davidgatheru490@gmail.com incase of corrections, directions or collaboration.
